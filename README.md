Overview
# Description: 
> PTSO. AI is an algorithm that helps users perfect their business professional, business casual, and casual outfits. It will give options on what needs to be changed to achieve these looks.  


# App Evaluation:
**Story:**
> The app analyzes the user's outfit through an image and classifies it into categories like Business Professional, Business Casual, or Casual. If the outfit does not fit the desired dress code, the app offers suggestions to improve the look and provides explanations for why a particular category was chosen. It serves users who want to ensure their outfits match appropriate attire requirements for various occasions, whether for work, formal events, or casual outings. 

**Market:** 
> This app can appeal to a broad audience, including professionals who need to adhere to dress codes, fashion enthusiasts looking for style feedback, and individuals preparing for events like job interviews, dates, or presentations. The app would be especially helpful for users who need guidance on fashion etiquette or who want to ensure their outfit aligns with the expectations of specific social or professional environments. 

**Habit:**
> Users could turn to this app regularly to check their daily outfit choices before leaving for wok, interviews, or social events. It could also become a go-to resource for those attending special occasions where they want reassurance that their attire is appropriate. Frequent users may develop a habit of capturing their outfits daily, seeking fashion tips, or refining their style based on the app's suggestions. 

**Scope:**
> Initially, the app will focus on categorizing outfits and providing improvement suggestions based on dress codes. Future development could include personalized style recommendations, seasonal outfit guides, integration with shopping platforms for suggested items, and even fashion tracking over time to help users analyze their evolving sense of style. The app could eventually expand to offer social features, where users can share outfit choices with friends or a broader fashion community for further feedback.
